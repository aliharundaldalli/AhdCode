// Pseudonymization: swapping identifying text for tokens.
//
// This is not redaction, and not an edit either. Redaction takes content
// out and leaves a gap; an edit puts new text in but appends it, leaving
// the original readable in the revision underneath. Pseudonymization
// needs both halves — the token has to appear and the original has to be
// gone — so the substitution is reflowed into the page and the result is
// written as a fresh file rather than appended.
//
// Doing that in one call matters: the two steps are easy to write
// separately and easy to stop after the first, which produces a document
// that looks anonymous and hands the original back to anyone who
// truncates it at the first end-of-file marker.

// Pseudonym is one substitution: every occurrence of From becomes To.

	// When To would set wider than From did — measured with the replaced
	// occurrence's own font and size — To is set at a smaller size, so
	// that it takes exactly the width From took and every line break in
	// the paragraph stays where it was. It never enlarges: a token
	// narrower than what it replaces keeps its size, and the line gains
	// slack. It never goes below 45% of the run's size either; where
	// even that leaves the token wider, it is set at the floor and the
	// paragraph re-wraps as it otherwise would, because a token nobody
	// can read is the worse of the two failures.

	// meant to be matched: a key-reversible stand-in is long by
	// construction, and dropped over a short word — "[[PII_LOCATION_001]]"
	// where "Milo" was — it needs a fifth of the size, not a half.
	// Refusing to go that small means the paragraph re-wraps, and a
