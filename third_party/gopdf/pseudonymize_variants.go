// The characters a document writes and a reader reports are not always
// the same one.
//
// Swiss and German legal documents routinely set every gap as U+00A0, the
// non-breaking space, and every hyphen in a compound as U+00AD, the soft
// hyphen. Extraction normalises neither: what comes out holds the
// characters the file holds. So a caller asking to replace
// "Ada Lovelace", typed with an ordinary space, matches nothing at all in
// a document that wrote "Ada Lovelace" — and is told, correctly and
// unhelpfully, that there was nothing to replace.
//
// Rather than have every caller know this, each mapping is expanded into
// the variants a document might have used. They are ordinary
// substitutions once expanded, so the check that nothing survives covers
// them without knowing they exist.

// variantChars maps a character a caller is likely to type to the ones a
// document is likely to have written instead.

// expandVariants returns the mapping together with every spelling of it
// the document might carry, all replaced by the same token.
//
// Order is significant: the caller's own spelling comes first, and the
// list is free of duplicates, so a string with nothing to vary expands to
// itself alone.
