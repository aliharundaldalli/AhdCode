// Finding text that is not text.
//
// A scanned letterhead is pixels. Nothing in the content stream says
// "Ada Lovelace"; the name is a shape, and every rule in this package
// that works on characters walks straight past it. Redacting such a
// document by text alone produces a file that looks carefully handled
// and still shows the name to anyone who looks at it.
//
// So an engine can be plugged in to read the pixels. This package does
// not carry one: recognising text well is a large problem with mature
// solutions, and a poor one here would be worse than none, since a word
// it misses is a word left in a document someone believes is clean. What
// this package does is the part it is placed to do — turning the boxes an
// engine reports into regions of the right image, scrubbing those pixels,
// and reading the result back to confirm the words are gone.

// OCRWord is one word an engine recognised, positioned in the image's own
// pixel coordinates with the origin at the top-left.

	// Text is the word as recognised.

	// X, Y, W and H bound the word in pixels.

	// Confidence runs from 0 to 1. An engine that does not report one
	// should leave it at 1.
	Confidence float64
}

// OCREngine reads the text in an image.
//
// Implementations live outside this package: see ocr/tesseract for one
// that drives the tesseract command. An engine is called once per image
// per page, and may be called again on the redacted image to confirm the
// words are gone, so it should be safe to call more than once.
