// Matching text that a content stream broke up.
//
// A word is not one operation in a content stream. Kerning, a change of
// colour, a ligature or nothing more than a producer's whim can split
// "Administration" into "Administra" and "tion", and searching each run
// on its own would then find neither. For redaction that failure mode is
// the wrong way round: a name left in the file is worse than a little
// text removed with it. So matching runs over a whole line at a time.
//
// Runs are only joined when they continue each other: same baseline, and
// the next one starting about where the last one ended. A gap wide enough
// to be a space becomes one, which stops a match running across columns,
// and a change of line breaks the chain entirely.
